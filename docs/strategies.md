# Cache Invalidation Strategies

The cache invalidation strategies provided by PGCacheWatch play a crucial role in maintaining the balance between data freshness and system efficiency. Below are detailed descriptions and ASCII art visualizations for each strategy.

## Greedy Strategy
The Greedy strategy is the most straightforward approach, where the cache is invalidated immediately upon any database event that affects the cached data. This strategy ensures the highest level of data freshness by aggressively keeping the cache up-to-date, making it ideal for applications where the accuracy and timeliness of data are paramount.

### Visualization
In this visualization, each database event—be it an insert, update, or delete—triggers an immediate cache invalidation, signifying the 'Greedy' nature of this strategy.
```
Event Stream:  | Insert | Update | Delete |
               |--------|--------|--------|
Cache State:   Invalidate -> Invalidate -> Invalidate
```

## Windowed Strategy
The Windowed strategy collects events over a defined period or counts and invalidates the cache only when the specified threshold is reached. This batching approach minimizes the overhead of frequent cache invalidations, making it a suitable choice for applications where slight data staleness is acceptable. The strategy effectively balances system performance with data freshness by reducing the load on the system.

### Visualization
Here, the cache is not invalidated at every event. Instead, it waits until a window of either 5 events or 30 seconds is reached before performing a single invalidation, illustrating the 'Windowed' strategy's approach to balancing performance with freshness.

```
Event Stream:  | Insert | Insert | Update | ... (5 events within 20 seconds) |
Cache State:                                Invalidate once after 5th event
```

## Timed Strategy
The Timed strategy involves invalidating the cache at predetermined time intervals, regardless of the database activity. This strategy provides a predictable pattern of cache invalidation, making it best suited for applications with less dynamic data or where slight delays in data updates are acceptable. The Timed strategy optimizes cache management by ensuring periodic refreshes without the need for monitoring specific database events.

### Visualization
In this scenario, cache invalidation occurs strictly based on time intervals (every 10 minutes in this example), regardless of when database events occur. This visualization highlights the 'Timed' strategy's focus on time-based cache refreshes rather than event-driven invalidations.
```
Event Stream:  | Insert |       10 minutes       | Update |
Cache State:   Invalidate -> Wait -> Invalidate -> Wait
```

## Choosing the Right Strategy
Selecting the appropriate cache invalidation strategy requires a thorough assessment of your application's specific needs regarding data freshness, performance implications, and the frequency of data changes. Each strategy offers distinct advantages and trade-offs, making it essential to align the choice with your application's operational requirements and objectives.
